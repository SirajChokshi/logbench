## Framework/Tooling

> QwikCity is just a extra set of tools on top of Qwik to make it easier to build a full site, including directory-based routing, layouts, and more. &mdash; <cite>BuilderIO/Qwik Docs</cite>

This project is using Qwik with the [QwikCity](https://qwik.builder.io/qwikcity/overview) meta-framework and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for the development environment. We're not using anything that would require QwikCity, but some bloat is worth being future-proof if more content is added.

## Development

```sh
pnpm dev
```

## Production

```shell
pnpm build
```

```sh
pnpm preview
```
