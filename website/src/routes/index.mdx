## Documentation

When developing a library it can be useful to warn consumers of issues with their usage of your library. This can be done with `console.warn` but it can be difficult to see these warnings in the console when there are many other logs. 

Logbench provides a way to log warnings to the console in a way that stands out and disable these warnings in production.


## Example


### Setup

```ts
import { Logbench } from 'logbench'


export const logger = new Logbench({
  warnFn: (message) => console.log(
    %c`${message}`,
    `
      font-size: 18px;
      background: black;
      color: white; 
    `
  )
})
```

### Usage

```ts
import { logger } from '@/lib/logger'

// will only log in development
// and styled in a way that stands out
logger.warn('This is a warning')
```


## API

When constructing a new instance of `Logbench` you can pass in an object with the following properties:
